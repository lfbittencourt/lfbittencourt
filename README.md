# Hello ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m LuÃ­s.

I've been programming for the web since the mid-2000s using several languages and tools such as Node.js, Python, REST APIs, relational databases, and Linux. Iâ€™m also an MSc student researching multimodal real estate valuation models. My main interests are machine learning and full stack engineering using JavaScript, Node.js, and Python.
